# README.md

# note: when you go through the workflow then reset DTR then save and submit the form, you 
# get an error with a link that I cannot find http://localhost:8090/etasu/met, I haven't looked
# into that too much yet 

# note number 2: if you reset the rems database with the button in the settings then you get an 
# error with the link http://localhost:8090/etasu/reset, that link is used in RequstBox.js but 
# I don't know what it is acting up since the only link I touch near it looks like it is right

# note number 3: removing the links from the properties.json file leads to some errors with 
# the sumbit to rems admin button, for now I've left it but eventually that will be addressed
# since it likely means that I've missed the use of some link
